1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    4. Name 3 elements that are display blocks by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    
1. A block element is an element that always starts on a new line that takes up the full width available. An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up necessary width.

2. When an element is positioned absolutely, the position is relative to the nearest pointed ancestor unless it does not have a positioned ancestor.

3. Use the code "flex-wrap" to ensure the elements in the line take up needed space. There are three ways to do it, they are wrap, nowrap, and wrap-reverse.

4. Display blocks by default: <ol>, <p>, and <table>. Display inline by default include, but are not limited to, <img> or <cite>. An element that is an inline block by default is <span>.

5. The box model is used in terms of design and layout. The box model is what holds CSS together. It starts with content inside, second padding, third border, and then margin in the outside.
